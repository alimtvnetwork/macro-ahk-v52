# Prompts Index

Canonical index of every persisted prompt under `.lovable/prompts/`.
Each prompt file captures a verbatim instruction or protocol from the
user so that future AI sessions can reload the exact intent without
re-deriving it from chat history.

## Format

- One row per prompt file, in numeric order.
- The **Tags** column lists every trigger phrase or short alias the
  user has used to invoke the prompt — so a future AI can `grep` for
  any of those phrases and land on the right file.
- Status: `active` (currently in force) / `superseded` (replaced by a
  newer version) / `archived` (one-shot, no longer needed).
