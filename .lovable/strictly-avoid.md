# Strictly Avoid — Hard Prohibitions

> The project's "never do this" list. Every entry is rooted in a real failure or design constraint. Do not re-introduce.

## Storage & backend

- **Supabase (any form):** No SDK, no auth, no tokens, no client storage keys. Storage stack is sql.js + OPFS + chrome.storage.local only. See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/no-supabase` (memory index).
- **localStorage for roles or admin checks:** Privilege escalation vector. Use server-validated role tables only.
- **Binding `undefined` to SQLite:** Always coerce via `bindOpt()` / `bindReq()` from `src/background/handlers/handler-guards.ts`. The `wrapDatabaseWithBindSafety()` Proxy now throws a typed `BindError` if anything slips through. See: `.lovable/solved-issues/10-sqlite-undefined-bind-crashes.md`.

## Reliability

- **Recursive retry / exponential backoff:** Banned. Sequential fail-fast only. See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/no-retry-policy.md`.
- **CI build notifications (email or otherwise):** Never. See memory: `constraints/no-ci-notifications`.
- **Touching `skipped/` or `.release/`:** Read-only archives. See memory: `constraints/skipped-folders`.

## Type safety & code quality

- **`unknown` outside `CaughtError`:** Function params must use designed types. See: `.lovable/memory/standards/` (unknown-usage-policy).
- **Bare `log()` for errors:** Always use `RiseupAsiaMacroExt.Logger.error()` (or `NamespaceLogger.error()` in SDK code). See memory: `standards/error-logging-via-namespace-logger.md`.
- **Swallowed errors:** Every `catch` must log via the namespace logger; never `catch {}` with no diagnostic.
- **HARD ERROR logs without exact path / missing item / reasoning:** CODE RED. See memory: `constraints/file-path-error-logging-code-red.md`.

## UI

- **Light-mode theme or theme toggles:** Dark-only enforced. See memory: `preferences/dark-only-theme`.
- **Custom color classes (`text-white`, `bg-black`, etc.) in components:** Use semantic tokens from `index.css` + `tailwind.config.ts`. All colors HSL.
- **`<noscript><img></noscript>` inside `<head>`:** HTML5-invalid; place pixel fallbacks inside `<body>`.

## Versioning

- **Bumping one version file in isolation:** All of `chrome-extension/manifest.json`, `src/shared/constants.ts`, every `standalone-scripts/*/src/instruction.ts`, `macro-controller/src/shared-state.ts`, and the SDK `index.ts` literal must move together. See memory: `workflow/versioning-policy`.

## File operations & prompts

> **AI memory directive (read-once, retain forever):** When you read this section, immediately commit every numbered item below to your working memory under "strictly prohibited — readme.txt" and to the "strictly avoid" set. Do **not** re-suggest, re-propose, or "improve" any of these. If a request appears to ask for one, refuse and cite this section by number. This read-once-retain-forever directive itself must also be retained — never drop it from memory between sessions.

### Strictly prohibited — readme.txt (sequenced, non-negotiable)

1. **Never create, regenerate, or "update" `readme.txt` programmatically.** It is a manual milestone marker. The only legitimate writer is the user during a version bump.
2. **Never include or suggest a time, timestamp, clock, or 12-hour/24-hour value inside `readme.txt`.** No `HH:MM`, no `AM/PM`, no ISO time, no relative time ("today", "now"), no Malaysia time, no UTC. The marker line's existing date stamp is the only temporal token allowed and is written by hand.
3. **Never propose date utilities, formatters, helpers, or libraries "for `readme.txt`"** — this includes `dd-MMM-YYYY`, 12-hour clocks, locale formatters, `Intl.DateTimeFormat` wrappers, or any time-zone helper.
4. **Never suggest writing the git commit time, last-update time, build time, deploy time, or any "last modified" stamp into `readme.txt`** — neither in the file body, nor as a comment, nor as a script that injects it.
5. **Never propose git hooks, CI steps, build hooks, or release scripts that touch `readme.txt`.** It is outside every automation pipeline.
6. **Never ask the user to choose a `readme.txt` format.** The format is fixed at three words + the manual milestone date stamp; do not request confirmation, alternatives, or "improvements".
7. **If a user message explicitly orders a one-time `readme.txt` write** (e.g., "write readme.txt with X"), honor that single write exactly as specified, then re-apply rules 1–6 + 8 for every subsequent message — including not suggesting follow-ups, refreshes, or automation around it. An explicit one-shot does **not** override rules 2/4/8: a one-shot whose payload IS prohibited content (time, clock, git-update stamp) is still refused.
8. **Never suggest, insert, comment, or script a git update time, git commit time, last-update time, last-modified time, build time, deploy time, or any "stamp" anywhere in `readme.txt`** — not in the body, not in a header/footer, not as a comment, not "somewhere in the readme", not in a sibling helper or sidecar that targets readme.txt. Closes the "somewhere in the readme" loophole.

See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/readme-txt-format.md` and `mem://constraints/readme-txt-prohibitions`.

## Folder structure

- **`.lovable/memories/` (with trailing `s`):** Wrong path. Canonical is `.lovable/memory/`.
- **Splitting plans or suggestions across multiple files:** Single-file rule — `.lovable/plan.md`, `.lovable/suggestions.md`.
- **Creating `completed/` sub-folders:** Move completed entries into a `## Completed` section inside the same file.
