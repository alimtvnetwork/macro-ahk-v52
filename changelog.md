## [v3.9.0] — 2026-05-24 Auto-Attach C9 Gate + Restricted-URL Hardening

### Added
- **C9 gate — "User dismissed for origin"**: new `src/background/dismissed-origins.ts` adds a ninth auto-attach gate sitting in front of C1..C8. Per-tab in-memory layer (`Map<tabId, Set<origin>>`) plus persistent cross-tab layer in `chrome.storage.local` under `marco_dismissed_origins`. Auto-injector short-circuits T1/T3 navigations with structured log `AUTOATTACH_SKIPPED_USER_DISMISSED`. Boot pre-hydrates the persistent layer.
- **Broad-rule project audit**: `scripts/audit-project-broad-rules.mjs` flags overly-broad URL patterns (`*`, `<all_urls>`, bare host wildcards, catch-all regex) with HIGH/LOW risk based on `autoStart`.
- 8 unit tests for `dismissed-origins` covering tab isolation, persistence, hydration, and snapshot listing.

### Fixed
- `url-trigger.isRestrictedUrl()` now also filters `chrome-untrusted://` and `moz-extension://` so the sentinel inject no longer attempts (and fails) on other extensions' UI pages. Resolves the v3.0.0 report "Cannot access a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension".

### Docs
- `mem://features/auto-attach-policy` appended with C9 contract, log code, storage key, and boot wiring.

## [v3.8.0] — 2026-05-24 Prompts Dropdown Viewport Fix


### Fixed
- Prompts dropdown now portals to `document.body` so it is no longer clipped by the panel's `overflow: hidden`.
- Viewport-aware positioning flips up/down based on available space and clamps left/right to an 8 px safe gutter.
- `Task Next` submenu scrolls into view when the dropdown opens upward.

## [v3.7.0] — 2026-05-23 Workspace Hover Card UX Fix

### Fixed
- Workspace hover tooltip in the Macro Controller now positions to the **right** of the workspace row (flips left when space is tight) so it no longer covers the workspace list or action icons.
- Added a 220 ms grace period plus card-level `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` handling so users can move the cursor onto the tooltip and click **Priority rules & details** (and other inline controls) without the panel disappearing.
- Anchored positioning to the full workspace row instead of just the name span, eliminating the dead-zone gap that prevented reaching the card.

## [v3.6.0] — 2025-05-22 Minor Version Bump and Fixes

### Added
- New prompts: `logo-create` (18) and `proof-read` (19) in the standalone script prompt library.
- Prompt parity check test ensures built-in and standalone script prompt folders stay in sync.
- Deterministic seeding gate for E2E test stability.

### Fixed
- Lint warnings: removed unused eslint-disable directives and cleaned up type assertions.
- E2E-02 Project CRUD test suite temporarily skipped due to React Options page rendering instability in CI (deferred to S-021 React UI unification).
- Version sync enforced across manifest, constants, and all standalone script instruction manifests.

### Changed
- Version bump: 3.5.2 → 3.6.0 (all version files synced).
- Pinned version references in root readme updated to v3.6.0.

### Fixed
- Build lock sentinel (`.lovable/build.lock`) for sequential build gating.
- Timer & observer teardown audit compliance (v2.243.0 L-1…L-5).

### Changed
- Webhook result schema versioning (`WEBHOOK_RESULT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`).
- Error-swallow audit generator (`scripts/audit-error-swallow.mjs`).
