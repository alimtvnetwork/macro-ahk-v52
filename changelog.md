Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [v2.249.4] — 2026-05-16 Wire AC-2 ps1 resolver test into CI

### Changed
- **`package.json`** — `test:installer` now appends `pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/installer/resolver.ps1.test.ps1` as the 5th suite; added `test:installer:resolver-ps1` alias.
- **`.github/workflows/installer-tests.yml`** — Linux job already installs pwsh so the new suite runs as part of `npm run test:installer`; Windows job adds a dedicated "Run AC-2 resolver suite on native Windows PowerShell" step so AC-2 is exercised on real Windows pwsh too. Header comment block updated to list 5 suites.

---

## [v2.249.3] — 2026-05-16 install.ps1 — AC-2 resolver unit test

### Added
- **`tests/installer/resolver.ps1.test.ps1`** — 6 sub-tests, 13 assertions covering `Get-LatestVersion`: 200+empty body, 200+missing `tag_name`, 404 (all three resolve to `__MAIN_BRANCH__` sentinel), 500 and bare network failure (both `exit 5` with spec §2.3 banner), and the happy 200+tag path. Runs via `pwsh -NoProfile -File`, dot-sources installer under `MARCO_INSTALLER_TEST_MODE=1`, mocks `Invoke-WebRequest` in a child pwsh process so `exit 5` is captured via `$LASTEXITCODE` without killing the harness.

---

## [v2.249.2] — 2026-05-16 install.ps1 — AC-2 main-branch fallback parity

### Changed
- **`scripts/install.ps1`** — `Get-LatestVersion` now distinguishes (a) 200 OK + tag → tag, (b) 200 OK + missing `tag_name` → `__MAIN_BRANCH__` sentinel, (c) 404 → sentinel, (d) 5xx / network failure → exit 5. Mirrors `install.sh fetch_latest_version`.
- **`scripts/install.ps1`** — added `Get-MainBranchTarball` that downloads `https://github.com/$Repo/archive/refs/heads/$branch.tar.gz`, no checksum (file lives in releases, not branches), and exits 5 on network failure.
- **`scripts/install.ps1`** — `Get-Asset` routes through `Get-MainBranchTarball` when the resolved version equals the sentinel.
- **`scripts/install.ps1`** — Main banner emits `🌿 Discovery mode — main branch (no releases found)` on fallback; VERSION file records `<branch>@HEAD` instead of the sentinel.
- **`scripts/install.ps1`** — added `$script:MarcoMainBranch` default (`main`, overridable via `MARCO_MAIN_BRANCH` env).

### Docs
- **`.lovable/memory/suggestions/20260424-1900-suggestion-installer-ac2-main-branch-fallback.md`** — status updated to fully implemented (sh + ps1).

---

## [v2.249.1] — 2026-05-16 Open-tabs workspace mapping memory written

### Docs
- **`.lovable/memory/features/macro-controller/open-tabs-workspace-mapping.md`** — captured the per-tab workspace mapping contract (transport, no-retry, 600 ms timeout, shared `LOVABLE_TAB_PATTERNS`, classified `Reason`+`ReasonDetail` failure-log schema). Indexed in `.lovable/memory/index.md`.
- **`plan.md`** — closed the 2026-04-27 "Open Lovable Tabs → Workspace Mapping" cluster (4/5 items done; 2 React/component tests deferred per `mem://preferences/deferred-workstreams`).

---

## [v2.249.0] — 2026-05-16 Shared LOVABLE_TAB_PATTERNS constant

### Added
- **`src/shared/lovable-tab-patterns.ts`** — single source of truth for `chrome.tabs.query()` match patterns covering the Lovable platform.

### Changed
- **`src/background/handlers/open-tabs-handler.ts`**, **`src/background/auth-health-handler.ts`**, **`src/background/cookie-watcher.ts`**, **`src/background/handlers/config-auth-handler.ts`** — replaced four local copies of the pattern array with imports of the shared constant. `config-auth-handler` spreads the shared list and appends its dev-only `localhost` patterns.

### Fixed (collateral)
- **`open-tabs-handler`** previously listed only 4 patterns (missing `lovableproject.com`), so the "Open Lovable Tabs" panel silently omitted any tab on `*.lovableproject.com`. Now matches the same 6 hosts the rest of the background uses.

### Why
- Closes plan.md "Open Lovable Tabs → Workspace Mapping" follow-up #4. Removes drift risk: previously each new platform host had to be added in three different files by hand.

---

## [v2.248.0] — 2026-05-16 Open-tabs probe failure logging (LOG-1 compliance)

### Added
- **`src/background/handlers/open-tabs-handler.ts`** — workspace-probe failures are now classified with a short `ProbeFailureReason` code (`NoTabId` | `NoReceiver` | `EmptyResponse` | `ProbeFailed` | `Exception`) plus a `ReasonDetail` string, attached to every `OpenLovableTabInfo` row and emitted as a structured background-log line via `logBgError(BgLogTag.OPEN_TABS, ...)`. The benign `NoReceiver` case (controller not yet injected into the tab) uses `console.debug` to keep noise low; all other reasons land in the SQLite errors table.
- **`src/background/bg-logger.ts`** — added `BgLogTag.OPEN_TABS = "[open-tabs]"`.

### Why
- Closes plan.md "Open Lovable Tabs → Workspace Mapping" follow-up #5 and brings the handler into compliance with the Core "Failure logs (mandatory shape)" rule (every failure MUST log `Reason` + `ReasonDetail`). Previously the only failure signal was a free-text `probeError` string on the response row — invisible to the diagnostics export and impossible to grep by category.

---

## [v2.247.0] — 2026-05-16 Smoke-test + CI dist path fix

### Fixed
- **`scripts/smoke-test-background.mjs:54`** — pointed at `../chrome-extension/dist/background/index.js`, but `vite.config.extension.ts` writes `DIST_DIR = chrome-extension/` (no `/dist` subfolder). The dynamic `import()` was silently 404'ing, so the smoke test never actually validated the background bundle. Updated to `../chrome-extension/background/index.js`.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml:2103`** — same stale `chrome-extension/dist` path in the "Verify no source maps in dist" step. The `find` returned empty regardless of whether maps were present, defeating the gate. Updated to `find chrome-extension -name '*.map'`.

### Why
- Both were collateral from an earlier folder layout. With these fixed, the smoke test now exercises the real bundle and the no-sourcemap check actually fails the build when a `.map` leaks into production output.

---

## [v2.246.0] — 2026-05-16 Project-ID cache (audit U-4)

### Changed
- **`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/workspace-detection.ts`** — `extractProjectIdFromUrl()` is now memoized per `window.location.href`. The function has ~10 callers per loop tick (credit balance, page workspace responder, startup heartbeat, global handlers, MacroController); each call previously re-ran the full pattern chain. Cache key is the raw `href`, so any URL change (push/replace/popstate, full reload, tab switch into a new URL) naturally invalidates by mismatch.
- **`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/spa-route-guard.ts`** — calls the new `invalidateProjectIdCache()` before reading the project ID inside `evaluateRouteChange()` to guarantee the post-navigation read is fresh (defensive — href is already updated by the time history mutations fire, but explicit invalidation removes any ordering doubt).

### Why
- Closes audit item **U-4** in `.lovable/audits/2026-05-16-url-trigger-and-energy-audit.md`. Eliminates redundant URL regex work on the hot path without changing semantics.

---

## [v2.245.0] — 2026-05-16 SPA route guard (audit U-5)

### Added
- **`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/spa-route-guard.ts`** — page-side complement to the v2.244.0 background URL trigger gate. Monkey-patches `history.pushState`/`history.replaceState` and listens for `popstate` so the macro controller detects SPA navigation away from `/projects/{id}` (or switching to a different project id) and **stops the running loop** before it can act on a stale `state.projectId`. Also stops the loop on `pagehide` (BFCache + unload) so a restored page does not resume with a zombie heartbeat.
- Returns a `teardown()` that restores the original history methods and removes both listeners. Idempotent via `window.__marcoRouteGuardInstalled`. No `setInterval`, no retry, never throws from inside the patched method (would break the page's own router).

### Wired
- `startup.ts` calls `installSpaRouteGuard()` immediately after `setupDiagnosticDump()` so it is the first thing protecting against route changes.

### Audit
- Closes U-5 (P2) in `.lovable/audits/2026-05-16-url-trigger-and-energy-audit.md`. U-4 (P2 — centralize `extractProjectIdFromUrl()` callers) remains deferred but is now lower priority because the route guard prevents the worst symptom (stale work on stale URL).

---

## [v2.244.0] — 2026-05-16 URL trigger gate + DOM sentinel cache (audit U-1…U-3, U-8)

### Added
- **URL trigger gate** (`src/background/url-trigger.ts`): single module wires the three — and only three — re-evaluation triggers per the user contract:
  - **T1 — initial load** via `webNavigation.onCompleted` (frameId 0)
  - **T2 — refresh** via `webNavigation.onCommitted` where `transitionType === "reload"`
  - **T3 — tab activate** via `chrome.tabs.onActivated`
  Each trigger fingerprints the URL with `urlFingerprint()` (origin + pathname + sorted query, hash stripped) and consults `tabDecisionCache` via `isSameDecisionFingerprint()`. Cache hit → short-circuit, zero work. No polling, no observers, no retry.
- **DOM sentinel** `<div id="__marco_sentinel__">` injected into the page MAIN world with `data-fp`, `data-projects`, `data-can-run`, `data-trigger`, `data-decided-at` so page-side checks become O(1) `document.getElementById()` lookups. Page-side reader at `src/content-scripts/sentinel-reader.ts` exposes `readSentinel()` / `isExtensionApplicableHere()`. Sentinel is a HINT — background `tabDecisionCache` remains authoritative.
- **`src/background/url-fingerprint.ts`** — stable URL fingerprint utility + unit tests (`__tests__/url-fingerprint.test.ts`): hash-strip, query-sort, malformed-URL fallback.
- **`state-manager.ts`**: new `TabDecision` type + `tabDecisionCache: Map<tabId, TabDecision>` with `getTabDecision`, `setTabDecision`, `clearTabDecision`, `isSameDecisionFingerprint`. Memory-only by design — SW restart re-warms from the next trigger. `removeTabInjection(tabId)` now also clears the decision-cache entry.

### Fixed
- **U-2 SPA pushState storm** (`src/background/spa-reinject.ts`): added per-tab `lastProbedFingerprint` map. Bursts of `pushState`/`replaceState` on the same effective URL (React routers re-syncing query params) now collapse into a single marker probe + `executeScript` round-trip instead of one per event.
- **U-8 cookie watcher fan-out** (`src/background/cookie-watcher.ts`): added 200 ms trailing debounce keyed by cookie name. A session refresh that rotates 3 cookies in <100 ms now triggers ONE `tabs.query()` instead of three. No retry, no exponential backoff (No-Retry policy upheld).

### Notes
- Hard rules captured in `mem://architecture/url-trigger-sentinel-cache`: never throw from a chrome event listener, sub-frames always ignored, no polling, no backoff inside gates.
- Audit & resolution: `.lovable/audits/2026-05-16-url-trigger-and-energy-audit.md`.

---

## [v2.243.0] — 2026-05-15 Loop and leak fixes (audit L-1…L-5)

### Fixed
- **L-1 workspace observer reschedule loop** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/workspace-observer.ts`): bounded mutation-driven reinstalls to 10 per 60 s window with a 2 s → 5 s → 15 s → 60 s backoff ladder; all `setTimeout` handles now tracked and cleared on `disconnect()`. Halts auto-reinstall with a single `Logger.error()` once the cap is hit.
- **L-2 recorder toolbar tick** (`src/background/recorder/recorder-toolbar.ts`): cadence reduced from 1 s to 5 s, paused while `document.hidden`, with a `pagehide` listener that auto-clears the interval and removes both the `visibilitychange` and `pagehide` listeners.
- **L-3 startup persistence observer** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/startup-persistence.ts`): now prefers `<main>`/`#root`, warns on `<body>` fallback, and `setupPersistenceObserver` returns a `teardown()` that disconnects the observer, cancels the pending reinjection timer/idle handle, and removes both listeners; `pagehide` invokes teardown automatically.
- **L-4 marco-sdk pollUntil tracking** (`standalone-scripts/marco-sdk/src/utils.ts`): every active `setInterval` now tracked in `_activePolls`, surfaced via the new `_diagActivePolls()` helper for leak introspection.
- **L-5 message relay in-flight cap** (`src/content-scripts/message-relay.ts`): outstanding `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` callbacks capped at 50; new requests beyond the cap reject immediately with `"Relay overloaded"` instead of accumulating closures.
- **Release pipeline missing `marco-extension-{VER}.zip`** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): the "Package release assets" step referenced the legacy `chrome-extension/dist/` subfolder, but the unpacked extension is built directly into `chrome-extension/` itself (`vite.config.extension.ts` → `outDir: resolve(__dirname, "chrome-extension")`, `powershell.json → distDir: "chrome-extension"`). The `cp` to the non-existent path failed under `set -eo pipefail`, leaving the GitHub Release page without the Chrome extension zip. Workflow now zips `chrome-extension/` directly, with a `manifest.json`-existence preflight and a post-zip size guard (fails if `< 10 KiB`) so the regression cannot silently recur. RCA: `mem://constraints/chrome-extension-dist-path`.

### Notes
- No-retry policy preserved: every backoff ladder is bounded and stops; nothing recurses.
- Source: `.lovable/audits/2026-05-15-infinite-loop-and-memory-leak-audit.md`.

## [v2.242.0] — 2026-05-15 SchemaVersion pinning and release version separation

### Fixed
- **SchemaVersion validation failure**: `scripts/bump-version.mjs` regex hardened with `\b` word boundary so `Version` bumps no longer accidentally overwrite `SchemaVersion` in instruction sources.
- **Compile-time guard**: `scripts/compile-instruction.mjs` now enforces `SchemaVersion: "1.0"` at emission — any source drift is auto-corrected before validation.

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.241.0 → 2.242.0 across all version-carrying files.
- Root `readme.md`: pinned install instructions and tags to `v2.242.0`.

---

## [v2.241.0] — 2026-05-14 Projects modal CSV export with git info

### Added
- **Projects modal — Export CSV** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/projects-modal.ts`): footer "⬇ Export CSV" button exports every loaded project to a `.csv` file with columns: `workspaceId, workspaceName, creditsUsed, creditsTotal, projectId, projectName, isOpenInChrome, gitRepo, gitBranch, lastCommunication, gitFetchError, extensionVersion, exportedAt`. Sequential per-project fetch with live progress (`Fetching git info: N / M (P%)`) per `mem://constraints/no-retry-policy`.
- **SDK endpoint**: `marco.api.projects.get(projectId)` (`standalone-scripts/marco-sdk/src/api-registry.ts`, `api.ts`) — fetches project metadata; tolerates missing `github_repo` / `github_branch` / `last_message_at` fields.

### Changed
- **Version bump**: 2.240.0 → 2.241.0 across all version-carrying files.

---

## [v2.240.0] — 2026-05-14 Changelog modal and root changelog synchronization

### Added
- **Read Memory prompt** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/15-read-memory/`): onboarding prompt for AI assistant memory reconstruction.
- **Write Memory prompt** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/16-write-memory/`): session-end memory persistence prompt.
- **Coding Guidelines prompt** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/17-coding-guidelines/`): project synthesis and task planning prompt.
- **Minor Bump prompt** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/08-minor-bump/`): automated minor version bump instruction.
- **Major Bump prompt** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/09-major-bump/`): automated major version bump instruction.

### Changed
- **Unified AI Prompt v4** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/04-unified-ai-prompt-v4/`): comprehensive 3-part framework update (repository analysis, spec fix workflow, test failure handling).
- **Rejog the Memory v1** (`standalone-scripts/prompts/03-rejog-the-memory-v1/`): proofread with reliability risk reports and Lovable suggestions filesystem contract.
- **Macro Controller changelog modal** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/changelog-modal.ts`): updated `CHANGELOG_ENTRIES` with v2.234.0–v2.240.0 entries.
- **Version bump**: 2.239.0 → 2.240.0 across all version-carrying files.

---

## [v2.233.0] — 2026-05-07 Macro controller panel layout fixes

### Fixed
- **Title bar `[ - ]` / `[ x ]` buttons** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/panel-header.ts`): added `white-space:nowrap;flex-shrink:0` so the minimize and close glyphs render on a single line and never wrap mid-bracket inside narrow panels.
- **Action button row clipping** (`standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/panel-controls.ts`): removed the legacy `min-width:460px` that forced the row wider than the panel's `overflow:hidden` content area, which clipped the rightmost action buttons (error toggle / hamburger menu) at the panel's default 494px width inside narrow Lovable sidebars. The flex-wrap layout already keeps buttons readable at any width.

### Changed
- **Version bump**: 2.232.0 → 2.233.0 across all version-carrying files.
- **Root `readme.md`**: pinned install instructions and tags to `v2.233.0`.

---

## [v2.232.0] — 2026-05-07 Manifest seeder PascalCase fix and version pin

### Fixed
- **Manifest seeder crash** (`src/background/manifest-seeder.ts`): resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `seedFromManifest` by updating lingering camelCase accesses (`p.name`, `p.scripts`, `p.configs`, `c.key`, `c.seedId`, `dependencyProject.scripts`, `dependencyScript.seedId`) to PascalCase, matching the migrated manifest shape.

### Changed
- **Version bump**: 2.231.0 → 2.232.0 across all version-carrying files.
- **Root `readme.md`**: pinned install instructions and tags to `v2.232.0`.

---

## [v2.231.0] — 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Version bump**: 2.230.0 → 2.231.0 across all 11 version-carrying files (manifest, `src/shared/constants.ts`, and standalone-scripts: `lovable-common`, `lovable-owner-switch`, `lovable-user-add`, `macro-controller` (instruction + shared-state), `marco-sdk`, `payment-banner-hider` (index + instruction), `xpath`).
- Verified with `node scripts/check-version-sync.mjs` — all version strings synchronized.

### Fixed
- **CI — Quality Badges workflow** (`.github/workflows/quality-badges.yml`): no longer hard-fails when neither `CODACY_PROJECT_ID` nor `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` is configured. The verify step now emits a `::notice::`, sets `skip=true`, and exits 0; downstream badge verification and summary steps are gated on `steps.verify_secrets.outputs.skip != 'true'`.
- **CI — Release artifact upload**: prior fix for `gh: Resource not accessible by integration (HTTP 403)` retained.

### Changed
- **`WebhookDeliveryResult` is now a discriminated union** keyed by the `Kind` field (`"success" | "skipped" | "failure"`). Each variant is exported from `src/background/recorder/step-library/result-webhook.ts` as `WebhookDeliverySuccess`, `WebhookDeliverySkipped`, and `WebhookDeliveryFailure`.
- Added runtime validator `validateWebhookDeliveryResult(raw)` — corrupt/legacy log entries are now surfaced as a synthetic `WebhookDeliveryFailure` with a clear `Corrupt webhook log entry — …` message instead of rendering `undefined` in the UI.

### Migration note

Do **not** access variant-specific fields directly on a `WebhookDeliveryResult` value. Narrow with the exported guards first:

```ts
import {
  isWebhookSuccess,
  isWebhookSkipped,
  isWebhookFailure,
  type WebhookDeliveryResult,
} from "@/background/recorder/step-library/result-webhook";

function describe(entry: WebhookDeliveryResult): string {
  if (isWebhookSuccess(entry)) return `OK ${entry.Status}`;          // Status: number
  if (isWebhookSkipped(entry)) return `Skipped: ${entry.SkipReason}`; // SkipReason: string
  if (isWebhookFailure(entry)) return `Failed: ${entry.Error}`;       // Error: string, Status: number | null
  return "Unknown";
}
```

Guards are mutually exclusive and provide full TypeScript narrowing. Reading `entry.SkipReason` / `entry.Error` / `entry.Status` without first calling the matching guard is a type error.

---

## [v2.141.0] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Header label mapping**: Title bar badge beside `TS Macro` now shows the project name first, while the status line below continues showing the workspace name
- **False workspace fallback**: Generic labels like `Preview` and raw project-name echoes are now rejected as workspace names during dialog detection and cache restore

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.140.0 → 2.141.0 (all synced version files updated)

---

## [v2.140.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Preview iframe guard**: Domain guard now blocks injection into `id-preview--*.lovable.app` hostnames and embedded iframes (`window !== window.top`), preventing auth timeout errors and false "Preview" workspace name detection

### Changed
- **Title bar badge priority**: Workspace name now displays first in the title bar badge (e.g., "P0155 RM-AR D5 P030") instead of project name; project name moved to tooltip
- Version bump: 2.139.0 → 2.140.0 (all 7 version files synced)

---

## [v2.139.0] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Auth contract unification**: Migrated all operational paths (`startup.ts`, `ws-move.ts`, `rename-api.ts`, `ws-adjacent.ts`, UI components) from legacy `resolveToken()`/`recoverAuthOnce()` to unified `getBearerToken()` / `getBearerToken({ force: true })` contract
- Updated `AuthDiagDeps` and panel wiring to support async token resolution
- Version bump: 2.133.0 → 2.139.0 (all 7 version files synced)

### Removed
- **Legacy auth functions**: Removed `resolveToken`, `recoverAuthOnce`, `invalidateSessionBridgeKey` — single Auth Bridge path enforced project-wide
- **Supabase references**: Purged all Supabase-specific auth/token/localStorage references from startup gate, diagnostics, and token retrieval — project uses its own auth system exclusively (extension bridge + cookie + signed URL)

### Fixed
- **TS build errors**: Removed unused imports, prefixed unused params with `_`, converted illegal `await` in non-async functions to `.then()` chains
- **Version sync**: All 7 version files (manifest.json version + version_name, constants.ts, shared-state.ts, instruction.ts ×3) now validated by `check-version-sync.mjs`

---

## [v2.119.0] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Resolved all 20 ESLint warnings across 16 files (cognitive-complexity, max-lines-per-function, unused directives)

---

## [v2.118.0] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.117.0 → 2.118.0 (all version files synced)
- CI: root `pnpm install` now always uses `--no-frozen-lockfile` (fixes missing lockfile error)

---

## [v2.117.0] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Release CI install failure**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` no longer hard-fails on `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` when `pnpm-lock.yaml` is absent — both root and `chrome-extension/` now fall back to `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile --lockfile=false`

### Added
- Release pipeline now runs root ESLint plus `chrome-extension` ESLint before tests
- Generated GitHub release notes now include Bash + PowerShell install commands, manual unpacked-install steps, and explicit `changelog.md` asset listing

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.116.0 → 2.117.0 (all version files synced)

---

## [v2.114.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Auth diagnostics — Help tooltips**: ❓ icon appears on Bridge FAILED rows with context-aware explanations (e.g. "Extension context invalidated" explains the page needs a refresh)
- **Toast redesign**: Solid dark minimal style (#1a1a2e) with left accent bar (green/red), stacking (max 3), smooth slide-up animation — replaces old flat colored toasts

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.113.0 → 2.114.0 (all version files synced)

---

### Fixed
- **Prompt dropdown — Task Next submenu**: snapshot restore path cleaned up Task Next sub-menus but never rebuilt them — hover/click stopped working after cache restore
- **Prompt dropdown — Load button**: replaced broken emoji icon (🔄 → ↻) with solid styled button; added error recovery so button doesn't stay stuck on failure
- **Prompt dropdown — Header rebind**: Load button lost onclick handler after snapshot restore — added `_rebindHeader()` to the rebind pipeline
- **Pale large prompts**: prompts with missing/empty text now show "(text not loaded)" label, dimmed badge, and helpful click toast instead of appearing silently broken

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.112.0 → 2.113.0 (all version files synced)

---

## [v2.112.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Hardcoded fallback prompt texts were stale summaries, not matching actual `prompt.md` source files — Unified AI Prompt v4 had unnumbered steps, Issues Tracking had completely wrong text, Audit Spec v1 had different rubric
- **ROOT CAUSE**: `computeBundledVersion()` only hashed `id:name:version` — text-only changes in `prompt.md` files did NOT trigger DB re-seeding, leaving stale text in SQLite forever
- Fixed Audit Spec v1 id mismatch: `default-audit` → `default-audit-spec` to match `info.json`

### Changed
- `computeBundledVersion()` now includes `text.length` in hash signature — any text change forces re-seeding
- All 14 hardcoded fallback prompts synced with actual `prompt.md` source files
- Parity test updated with corrected `default-audit-spec` id
- Version bump: 2.111.0 → 2.112.0 (all version files synced)

---

## [v2.111.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Large prompts (e.g., `Unit Test Issues V2 Enhanced`, 5689 chars) not appearing in dropdown — missing from both `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` (prompt-loader.ts) and `getFallbackDefaultPrompts()` (prompt-handler.ts) fallback lists
- `normalizePromptEntries()` silently dropped entries with empty name/text — now logs diagnostic warnings with entry id, slug, and reason for drop

### Added
- `Unit Test Issues V2 Enhanced` prompt added to all fallback prompt lists (14 → 15 entries)
- Diagnostic warning logs in `normalizePromptEntries()` when entries are dropped (aids future debugging)
- Version number displayed in startup timing waterfall summary footer (`v2.111.0`)
- Defensive integration test (`task-next-no-fallback.test.ts`) verifying no `entries[0]` fallback regression

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.110.0 → 2.111.0 (all version files synced)

---

## [v2.110.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- README **Installation (End Users)** section with quick-install one-liners for Linux/macOS (`curl | bash`) and Windows (`irm | iex`)
- Cross-platform install scripts: `install-extension.sh` (Bash) and `install-extension.ps1` (PowerShell) with `--version` and `--dir` flags
- Release assets table documenting all `.zip` packages, installer scripts, and metadata files
- Manual install instructions for loading the unpacked extension in Chromium browsers
- Automated prompt parity check test (`prompt-parity-check.test.ts`) ensuring `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` ↔ DB seed stay in sync
- Added missing `Code Coverage Basic`, `Code Coverage Details`, and `Audit Spec v1` entries to both prompt lists

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.109.0 → 2.110.0 (all version files synced)

---

## [v2.109.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **REGRESSION**: Duplicate project name displayed in panel header — removed dead `loop-project-name` element and `updateProjectNameDisplay()`, project/workspace name now shown exclusively via `wsNameEl` (id=`loop-title-ws-name`)
- **REGRESSION**: XPath-based workspace name extraction (`getProjectNameFromDom`) replaced with API-only resolution — `getDisplayProjectName()` no longer uses DOM XPath
- "Focus Current" now always re-detects workspace from API (`mark-viewed`) instead of using stale cached values
- Stop section now resolves workspace name from `loopCreditState.currentWs` as fallback, ensuring display regardless of loop state

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.108.0 → 2.109.0 (all version files synced)

---

### Fixed
- **REGRESSION**: "Next Task" flow incorrectly returned Start Prompt instead of the correct Next Tasks prompt — removed dangerous `entries[0]` fallback in `findNextTasksPrompt()` that silently returned the first prompt (Start Prompt) when no match was found
- **REGRESSION**: `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` fallback array in `prompt-loader.ts` was missing the "Next Tasks" entry entirely — added it with proper `slug: 'next-tasks'` and `id: 'default-next-tasks'` fields
- Excessive newline insertion in large prompts — enhanced `normalizeNewlines()` to handle Windows `\r\n` line endings and collapse blank-ish lines containing only whitespace between newlines
- All `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` entries now include `slug` and `id` fields for reliable lookup across all pipeline stages

### Added
- 6 new regression tests: `findNextTasksPrompt` selection logic (4 tests), Windows `\r\n` normalization, whitespace-between-newlines collapse
- Root cause analysis spec at `spec/22-app-issues/prompt-next-task-regression-newline-formatting-rca.md`

### Changed
- Version bump: 2.107.0 → 2.108.0 (all version files synced)

## [v1.77.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- Diagnostic logging in `findNextTasksPrompt()` — prints slug/id of every prompt entry during resolution to confirm fields survive the full pipeline (load → cache → resolve)

### Changed
- Macro Controller version bump: 2.106.0 → 2.107.0

---


### Added
- Regression tests for prompt normalization — 11 tests covering slug/id/isDefault field preservation and newline normalization

### Fixed
- `CachedPromptEntry` interface missing `slug` field — prompts lost slug after IndexedDB cache round-trip
- `prompt-dropdown.ts` local `PromptEntry` interface missing `slug` field

### Changed
- Macro Controller version bump: 2.105.0 → 2.106.0

---

### Fixed
- **Next Task regression** — `normalizePromptEntries()` dropped `slug`, `id`, `isDefault` fields causing `findNextTasksPrompt()` to always fall through to `entries[0]` (start prompt) instead of resolving the correct `next-tasks` slug
- **Excessive newlines in large prompts** — added `normalizeNewlines()` to collapse 3+ consecutive blank lines before editor injection

### Changed
- `pasteIntoEditor()` now normalizes whitespace before injecting prompt text
- Macro Controller version bump: 2.104.0 → 2.105.0

### Fixed
- `compile-instruction.mjs` — capture preamble `const` declarations (e.g. `LOVABLE_BASE_URL`) for `new Function()` evaluation context

### Verified
- Build pipeline (`npm run build:extension`) produces all 17 expected output files
- React UI unification Steps 1-9, 11-12 confirmed complete; content scripts already migrated
- `message-client.ts` already uses `getPlatform().sendMessage()` — no direct `chrome.runtime` calls
- CDP injection fallback fully documented (spec 47)
- AI onboarding checklist (S-029) already in master overview

---
