  { name: 'Unified AI Prompt v4', text: "# Unified AI Prompt \u2014 v4\n\n## Part 1 \u2014 Repository Analysis, Memory Reconstruction, and Implementation Readiness\n\n### Proofread prompt\n\nRead and synthesize existing repository context from the Lovable memory folder and the full specification set, then produce a reliability risk report before any implementation work begins. Do not implement anything. Only produce a report and specification-side artifacts for memory, suggestions, and planning.\n\n### Mandatory pre-analysis steps\n\nBefore producing any report or analysis, the AI must:\n\n1. **Scan the entire repository tree at the directory level** to understand project boundaries, folder structure, and dependencies. Do not read contents inside folders marked skipped, ignored, deprecated, generated, archived, or otherwise excluded.\n2. **Read workflow memory** \u2014 specifically `.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md` \u2014 to understand what has been done and what is pending. This avoids repeated work.\n3. **Read all relevant memory files** under `.lovable/memory/`, including workflow, suggestions, rules, decisions, history, issue references, and any protocol or process files present.\n\n### Goals\n\n1. Reconstruct project requirements by reading:\n   1. the .lovable memory content\n   2. the existing spec files and idea files across all projects\n2. Produce a detailed risk and failure-chance report for handing the current specs to another AI.\n3. Establish a disciplined workflow for Lovable suggestions tracking and future planning so another AI can continue work reliably.\n\n### Inputs to read\n\n1. .lovable/\n   1. memories/\n   2. memory/\n   3. memory/suggestions/\n   4. any other Lovable state folders present\n   5. What todo and what not to do \u2014 remember.\n   6. Folders marked skipped, ignored, deprecated, generated, or archived must not be read or modified \u2014 they may be listed structurally but their contents must not be opened.\n2. Spec folder content for all projects:\n   1. ideas\n   2. backend and frontend specs\n   3. specs\n   4. instruction builder specs\n   5. seeding and configuration specs\n   6. data model specs\n   7. acceptance criteria specs\n   8. Read root `spec/` folder or get a general idea of files.\n\n### Deliverable 1: Reliability and failure-chance report\n\n1. **Success probability estimates** by module complexity tier (simple, medium, complex agentic workflows, end-to-end), with explicit assumptions.\n2. **Failure map** \u2014 where (module + workflow), why (missing constraints, ambiguity, cross-file inconsistency), how it manifests.\n3. **Corrective actions** \u2014 prioritized list of spec fixes; for each: what to change, where, expected reliability gain.\n4. **Readiness decision** \u2014 classify each major area as: ready / ready with assumptions / blocked by ambiguity / blocked by contradiction / blocked by missing acceptance criteria. State what must be fixed before implementation and what can be deferred safely.\n\n### Deliverable 2: Lovable suggestions workflow (filesystem contract)\n\nAll suggestions must be tracked in a single file: `.lovable/memory/suggestions/01-suggestions.md`. If the file grows beyond manageable size (50+ items), suggestions may be split per project.\n\n**Suggestion entry fields:** suggestionId, createdAt, source (Lovable), affectedProject, description, rationale, proposed change, acceptance criteria, status (open, inProgress, done), completion notes.\n\n**Completion handling** \u2014 When a suggestion is completed, update its status to done. Optionally move completed items to `completed/` subfolder.\n\n### Deliverable 3: plan.md future work roadmap\n\n`.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md` is the **canonical workflow tracker**. Root `plan.md` (if created) is a **summarized AI handoff roadmap** only. It must not contradict the canonical plan.\n\n**plan.md requirements:**\n1. A prioritized backlog of tasks\n2. Grouping by phase and by project\n3. For each task: objective, dependencies, expected outputs (spec updates, UI changes, API changes), acceptance criteria\n4. A section titled **Next task selection** where the next implementable items are listed so the user can pick what to implement next.\n\n### Required Part 1 artifacts\n\n- `.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md`\n- `.lovable/memory/suggestions/01-suggestions.md`\n- `.lovable/memory/history/01-decisions.md` \u2014 create the `history/` folder if it does not exist\n- `.lovable/memory/01-working-rules.md` \u2014 if new rules or constraints are discovered\n- Root `plan.md` \u2014 only if a handoff roadmap is needed\n- Update memory issue references if analysis uncovers prior unresolved issue patterns\n\n### Interaction rule\n\nAfter producing the report and creating the memory and plan artifacts, ask which specific task should be implemented next since the specs define what to build.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2 \u2014 Specification Fix Workflow and Issue Documentation\n\n### Original input (verbatim)\n\nupdate spec properly so that the mistake doesn't appear and update memory and also write the details how you fixed it, and every time we fix it, add to do /spec/02-app/issues/01-{issue slug name}.md explain the issue first, then root cause analysis, how you fixed and how not to repeat it again, and if iterations required, then write all the iterations And put all the spec files in 01-app Keep it in your memory to update all the time so that mistakes don't happen this is the most important part the many times i have remind the mistakes make sure to update in the\n\n### Objectives\n\n1. Update the relevant spec files so the mistake cannot happen again.\n2. Update memory documentation to record the mistake, the fix, and the prevention rule.\n3. Every time a fix is made, create a dedicated issue documentation file under the required path.\n4. Consolidate all application spec files under a single folder.\n\n### Required folder structure\n\n- All application spec files: `/spec/01-app/`\n- All issue write-ups: `/spec/02-app/issues/`\n- File naming format: `{seq}-{issueSlugName}.md` (sequential numbering: 01, 02, 03\u2026)\n\n### issueSlugName rules\n\n- lowercase only\n- hyphen-separated\n- short, descriptive, and stable\n- no spaces or special characters\n\n### Issue numbering\n\nIssues use **sequential numbering** across the entire issues folder. Before creating a new issue, check the highest existing sequence number and increment by one.\n\n```\n/spec/02-app/issues/01-auth-timeout.md\n/spec/02-app/issues/02-cache-race-condition.md\n/spec/02-app/issues/03-missing-default-config.md\n```\n\n### Issue write-up file requirements\n\nCreate an issue file at `/spec/02-app/issues/{seq}-{issueSlugName}.md`. Sections in this exact order:\n\n**Issue summary** \u2014 what happened, where (feature/module + paths), symptoms and impact, how discovered.\n\n**Root cause analysis** \u2014 direct cause, contributing factors, triggering conditions, why existing spec did not prevent it.\n\n**Fix description** \u2014 spec changes (no code), new rules/constraints, why fix resolves root cause, config/default changes, logging or diagnostics required.\n\n**Iterations history** (only if multiple attempts) \u2014 Iteration 1: what was tried and why it failed. Iteration 2: ... continue until final resolution.\n\n**Prevention and non-regression** \u2014 prevention rule, acceptance criteria/test scenarios, guardrails or linting policies, references to exact spec sections updated (by file path), explicit testable regression prevention rule.\n\n**TODO and follow-ups** \u2014 remaining tasks, owners or roles if applicable.\n\n**Done checklist**\n- [ ] Spec updated under /spec/01-app/\n- [ ] Issue write-up created under /spec/02-app/issues/\n- [ ] Memory updated with summary and prevention rule\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria updated or added\n- [ ] Iterations recorded if applicable\n- [ ] Plan status updated in workflow tracker\n\n### Spec update requirements\n\nUpdate the relevant spec files under /spec/01-app/ to include: corrected behavior, explicit constraints to prevent the old mistake, failure modes and debugging guidance, acceptance criteria updates that make regression testable, and a **Known pitfalls and prevention** section that references the issue file path.\n\n### Memory update requirements\n\nMaintain a memory record updated every time a fix is made: short description of the mistake, prevention rule, reference to the issue write-up file path.\n\n**Memory update is mandatory. If memory is not updated the fix is incomplete.**\n\n### Decision logging\n\nAll important decisions must be written to `.lovable/memory/history/01-decisions.md`. If the `history/` folder does not exist, create it and use this file as the canonical decision log.\n\nRequired entries: architecture changes, spec interpretation decisions, rejected approaches and why, trade-off resolutions.\n\n### Output requirements\n\n1. A concise process checklist to follow after every fix.\n2. A copy-paste template for `/spec/02-app/issues/{seq}-{issueSlugName}.md`.\n3. A brief note stating all specs live under `/spec/01-app/`.\n\n**Formatting rule:** ensure there is a blank line after every Markdown header.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3 \u2014 Unit Test Failure Investigation and Documentation\n\n### Original input (verbatim)\n\nFix these and when fixing failing tests: 1. check code, 2. Method code actual one, 3. Logical implementation of the test, 4. Check Testcase, 5. Logically fix it either actual or the test depending on the logical discussion and write it.\n\n### Unit Test Failure Logic\n\n1. **Check code** \u2014 read the production code under test.\n2. **Method code actual implementation** \u2014 understand what the method actually does.\n3. **Logical implementation of the test** \u2014 read the test and understand what it asserts.\n4. **Check the testcase logic** \u2014 verify whether the test expectation is logically correct, including fixtures, mocks, seed data, and expected outputs.\n5. **Decide** \u2014 fix either the implementation or the test depending on which is logically wrong.\n\n### Documentation requirement for failing tests\n\nEvery failing test resolution must be documented at: `/spec/05-failing-tests/{seq}-failing-test-name.md`. Include:\n\n1. Root cause analysis\n2. Solution description\n3. Whether the issue was caused by incorrect implementation or incorrect test logic\n4. Any corrections made to test logic or implementation logic\n5. Prevention guidance so similar failures do not occur again\n6. **Reference to the relevant spec section** that governs the expected behavior\n\n---\n\n## Specification Authority\n\nThe specification is the source of truth.\n\n**Priority order (highest to lowest):**\n1. Specification files under `/spec/01-app/`\n2. Issue corrections under `/spec/02-app/issues/`\n3. Failing test documentation under `/spec/05-failing-tests/`\n4. Memory and decision logs\n5. Existing implementation code\n\nIf implementation contradicts the specification, the specification takes precedence unless the spec is proven incorrect. If the spec is proven incorrect, document the correction as an issue before changing the spec.\n\n---\n\n## Required Execution Order\n\nThe AI must follow this sequence strictly. Steps must not be skipped or reordered.\n\n1. Scan the entire repository tree.\n2. Read Lovable memory folders.\n3. Read workflow tracker `.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md`.\n4. Read specification folders.\n5. Reconstruct project context.\n6. Produce the reliability and failure-chance report.\n7. Propose spec corrections if required.\n8. Update memory artifacts.\n9. Update workflow plan.\n10. Ask the user which task to implement next.\n\n---\n\n## Context Preservation\n\nAfter any significant analysis, correction, or decision, the AI must summarize the key conclusions into Lovable memory files. Summaries must include: what was learned, what was decided, what constraints now exist, what must not be repeated.\n\n**If the AI does not persist conclusions to memory, the work is considered incomplete.**\n\n---\n\n## Task Selection Protocol\n\nWhen asking for the next task, present:\n1. The **top 3 next implementable tasks** from the plan\n2. Their **dependencies** (what must be done first)\n3. Their **estimated complexity** (simple / medium / complex)\n4. The **spec files involved**\n\nThen ask the user to select the task number.\n\n---\n\n## Blocker Handling\n\nIf a blocker prevents reliable implementation or specification updates:\n1. Record the blocker in `.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md`\n2. Document it in the relevant spec or issue file\n3. Explain the minimum information or change required to unblock progress\n4. Avoid guessing past the blocker\n\nThe AI must not silently work around blockers. Blockers must be surfaced to the user.\n\n---\n\n## Allowed Actions Before Implementation\n\nAnalysis, reporting, memory updates, planning, spec corrections, issue documentation, and test diagnosis documentation are allowed before implementation. Application code changes are **not allowed** until the user explicitly selects a task and authorizes implementation.\n\n---\n\n## Global Rules (apply to all parts)\n\n### Spec before code\nAlways write or update specs before any implementation. Never implement until the user explicitly says to start a specific phase or task.\n\n### Ambiguity handling\nIf the specification is ambiguous, the AI must **document the ambiguity** in the relevant spec file and in `.lovable/memory/history/01-decisions.md` before implementing a solution. Do not silently resolve ambiguity.\n\n### Repository scan requirement\nBefore implementation analysis, scan the entire repository tree at the directory level. Do not read contents inside folders marked excluded. Reading only the spec folder is insufficient.\n\n### Skipped folders\nFolders marked skipped, ignored, deprecated, generated, or archived must not be read or modified. They may be listed structurally but their contents must not be opened. This overrides any other instruction.\n\n### Code style (GitMap enforced)\n- All `if` conditions must be **positive** (no `!`, no negation).\n- Functions: **8\u201315 lines**.\n- Files: **100\u2013200 lines max**.\n- Small, focused packages \u2014 one responsibility per package.\n\n### Version bumping\nAny changes to code must bump at least the minor version. The `.release` folder is off-limits \u2014 do not read, modify, or reference it.\n\n### File naming\n- Use stable canonical filenames such as `01-plan.md`, `01-suggestions.md`, `01-decisions.md` for singleton tracker files.\n- Use `{seq}-{slug}.md` for repeating records such as issues and failing test write-ups.\n- Keep folder file counts small.\n- Plans and suggestions are tracked in single files and updated in place unless explicitly split by scale.\n\n### Regression prevention\nEvery fix \u2014 specs, code, or tests \u2014 must include an explicit, testable regression prevention rule.\n\n### Definition of Done\nA task is done only when:\n1. Spec updated (if applicable)\n2. Issue documented (if applicable)\n3. Memory updated\n4. Acceptance criteria added or verified\n5. Plan status updated in `.lovable/memory/workflow/01-plan.md`\n6. Decision log updated (if a decision was made)\n\n---\n\n## Final Instruction\n\nImplementation must not begin until readiness analysis and specification validation are completed and the user explicitly selects the next task.\n\nUse:\n1. **Required Execution Order** for sequencing\n2. **Specification Authority** for conflict resolution\n3. **Context Preservation** for memory persistence\n4. **Blocker Handling** for unresolved situations\n\n*Prompt v4.0.

  { name: "Write Memory", text: "# Write Memory\n\n> **Purpose:** After completing work or at session end, persist everything learned, done, and pending so the next AI session picks up with zero context loss.\n\n> **When to run:** End of session, after a task batch, or when asked to \"update memory\" / \"write memory\" / \"end memory\".\n\n---\n\n## Core Principle\n\nThe memory system is the project's brain. If you did something and didn't write it down, it didn't happen. Write as if the next AI has amnesia — because it does.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1 — Audit Current State\n\nTake inventory before writing:\n\n- **Done this session:** features, fixes, refactors, files created/modified/deleted, decisions and why.\n- **Still pending:** tasks started but not finished, discussed but not started, blockers and dependencies.\n- **Learned:** new patterns/conventions, gotchas, edge cases, user preferences (explicit or implicit).\n- **Went wrong:** bugs + root causes, failed approaches, things that should never be repeated.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2 — Update Memory Files\n\nTarget: `.lovable/memory/`\n\n1. Read `.lovable/memory/index.md` first. Do not create duplicates.\n2. Update existing memory files affected by this session — add new info in the right section, mark completed items `[x]` / ✅, **never truncate or overwrite unrelated entries**.\n3. Create new memory files (lowercase-hyphenated, numeric prefix `XX-name.md`) when knowledge doesn't fit any existing file. **Immediately update `index.md`**.\n4. Update workflow files in `.lovable/memory/workflow/` with status markers: ✅ Done, 🔄 In Progress, ⏳ Pending, 🚫 Blocked — [reason], 🚫 Blocked — [avoid].\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3 — Update Plans & Suggestions\n\n### 3A — Plans (`.lovable/plan.md`)\n- Update task statuses; add new tasks discovered this session.\n- Move fully-complete items to a `## Completed` section in the same file (do not delete).\n- Single source of truth for the roadmap.\n\n### 3B — Suggestions (`.lovable/suggestions.md`) — single file, with index folder for grouped suggestions\n\n```markdown\n## Active Suggestions\n### [Title]\n- **Status:** Pending | In Review | Approved | Rejected\n- **Priority:** High | Medium | Low\n- **Description:** What and why\n- **Added:** [date or session ref]\n\n## Implemented Suggestions\n### [Title]\n- **Implemented:** [date or session ref]\n- **Notes:** Implementation details\n```\n\nWhen implemented: move from Active → Implemented, add notes, reference commit/file/task.\n\nAlso write all Lovable suggestions in the appropriate folder with an index file for suggestions.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4 — Update Issues\n\n### 4A — Pending (`.lovable/pending-issues/XX-short-description.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# [Issue Title]\n## Description\n## Root Cause   (or \"Under investigation.\")\n## Steps to Reproduce\n## Attempted Solutions\n- [ ] Approach 1 — [result]\n## Priority   (High | Medium | Low)\n## Blocked By  (if any)\n```\n\n### 4B — Solved (`.lovable/solved-issues/`)\n\nWhen resolved, MOVE the file from pending → solved and append:\n\n```markdown\n## Solution\n## Iteration Count\n## Learning\n## What NOT to Repeat\n```\n\n### 4C — Strictly Avoided (`.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`)\n\nIf a solved issue revealed a forbidden pattern:\n\n```markdown\n- **[Pattern Name]:** [Why forbidden]. See: `.lovable/solved-issues/XX-filename.md`\n```\n\nAnything explicitly told to skip/avoid → `avoid` folder in memory.\n\n### 4D — CI/CD Issues (`.lovable/cicd-issues/XX-issue-name.md`)\n\nFor every CI/CD problem encountered, write a numbered file (sequence starts from 01) and maintain `.lovable/cicd-index.md` as a summary index. Collect every CI/CD issue properly. Do not repeat them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5 — Consistency Validation\n\n- **Index integrity:** every file in `.lovable/memory/` (incl. subfolders) listed in `index.md`.\n- **Cross-reference:** every ✅ Done in `plan.md` has evidence (memory update / solved issue / code change). Every actionable item in `pending-issues/` reflected in `plan.md` or `suggestions.md`. No file in both `pending-issues/` and `solved-issues/`.\n- **Orphan check:** no memory file without an index entry; no \"Implemented\" suggestion without code evidence; no `solved-issues/` file without a `## Solution` section.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\n```\n✅ Memory update complete.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Tasks completed: [X]\n- Tasks pending: [Y]\n- New memory files created: [Z]\n- Issues resolved: [N]\n- Issues opened: [M]\n- Suggestions added: [S]\n- Suggestions implemented: [T]\n\nFiles modified:\n- [list every file touched]\n\nInconsistencies found and fixed:\n- [list any, or \"None\"]\n\nThe next AI session can pick up from: [current state + next logical step]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6 — Verbatim Spec Capture\n\nReview current discussions. If a larger spec was given during the session, write it verbatim into the file system AND store the gist in memory so the next AI can find it. Recent specs and verbatims must land in the file system, not stay only in chat.\n\n---\n\n## File Naming & Structure Rules\n\n| Rule | Example |\n|------|---------|\n| Numeric prefix, lowercase, hyphen-separated | `01-auth-flow.md` ✅ / `01_Auth_Flow.md` ❌ |\n| Plans → single file | `.lovable/plan.md` |\n| Suggestions → single file (+ optional index folder) | `.lovable/suggestions.md` |\n| Pending/solved issues → one file per issue | `.lovable/pending-issues/01-login-crash.md` |\n| Memory → grouped by topic | `.lovable/memory/workflow/`, `.lovable/memory/decisions/` |\n| Completed → `## Completed` section in same file | NOT a separate `completed/` folder |\n\n### Folder Structure\n\n```\n.lovable/\n├── overview.md\n├── strictly-avoid.md\n├── user-preferences\n├── plan.md\n├── suggestions.md\n├── prompt.md                     # Index of canonical prompts\n├── prompts/                      # xx-name.md (lowercase hyphenated)\n├── cicd-index.md                 # Summary of CI/CD issues\n├── cicd-issues/                  # 01-issue.md, 02-issue.md, ...\n├── memory/\n│   ├── index.md\n│   ├── workflow/\n│   ├── decisions/\n│   ├── avoid/                    # things to skip/avoid\n│   └── [topic]/\n├── pending-issues/\n└── solved-issues/\n```\n\n> ⚠️ **NEVER** create `.lovable/memories/` (trailing `s`). The path is `.lovable/memory/`.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Corruption Rules\n\n1. **Never delete history** — mark done, move to completed sections.\n2. **Never overwrite blindly** — read before write; preserve existing content.\n3. **Never leave orphans** — every file indexed; every reference resolves.\n4. **Never split what should be unified** — plans and suggestions live in ONE file each.\n5. **Never mix states** — an issue is pending OR solved, never both.\n6. **Never skip the index update** — new memory file ⇒ update `index.md` in the same operation.\n7. **Never assume the next AI knows anything** — write as if explaining to a stranger.\n\n---\n\n## Important\n\n- Save trigger phrases: **\"write memory\"**, **\"end memory\"**, **\"update memory\"**.\n- Lose as little of the conversation as possible.\n- This prompt lives at `.lovable/prompts/03-write-memory.md`; root index `.lovable/prompt.md` references it.\n- Restructure any folder that doesn't match this layout. All `.md` files lowercase-hyphenated.\n\n*Prompt v3.0.*", slug: "write-memory", id: "default-write-memory", category: "onboarding" },
  { name: "Coding Guidelines", text: "# Coding Guidelines\n\n> **Purpose:** Read and synthesize existing repository context from the Lovable memory folder and the full specification set, then produce a reliability risk report before any implementation work begins. Do not implement anything. Only produce a report and specification-side artifacts for memory, suggestions, and planning.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Reconstruct project requirements by reading the .lovable memory content and the existing spec files and idea files across all projects.\n2. Produce a detailed risk and failure-chance report for handing the current specs to another AI.\n3. Establish a disciplined workflow for Lovable suggestions tracking and future planning so another AI can continue work reliably.\n\n## Inputs to read\n\n- .lovable/ (memories/, memory/, memory/suggestions/, any other Lovable state folders). Do NOT touch any skipped/ folder.\n- Spec folder content for all projects: ideas, backend/frontend specs, instruction builder specs, seeding/configuration specs, data model specs, acceptance criteria. Read root spec/ folder for a general idea.\n\n## Deliverable 1 — Reliability and Failure-Chance Report\n\n1. Success probability estimates by module complexity tier (simple, medium, complex agentic workflows, end-to-end), with explicit assumptions.\n2. Failure map — where failures are likely (module + workflow), why (missing constraints, ambiguity, cross-file inconsistency), how they manifest.\n3. Corrective actions — prioritized list of spec fixes; for each: what to change, where, expected reliability gain.\n4. Readiness decision — whether the spec set is ready for implementation; what must be fixed first.\n\n## Deliverable 2 — Lovable Suggestions Workflow\n\n- Location: .lovable/memory/suggestions — one file per suggestion.\n- File naming: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-suggestion-<slug>.md.\n- Content: suggestionId, createdAt, source (Lovable), affectedProject, description, rationale, proposed change, acceptance criteria, status (open/inProgress/done), completion notes.\n- On completion → status done; archive or remove per policy.\n\n## Deliverable 3 — plan.md Future Work Roadmap\n\nCreate plan.md at repo root: prioritized backlog grouped by phase and project. Each task: objective, dependencies, expected outputs (spec/UI/API), acceptance criteria. Include a Next task selection section listing implementable items.\n\n## Interaction rule\n\nAfter producing the report and creating the memory and plan artifacts, ask the user which specific task to implement next.\n\n*Prompt v1.0.
