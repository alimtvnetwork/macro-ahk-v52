/**
 * Lovable Owner Switch — Project Instruction Manifest
 *
 * Phase P4 scaffold: declares dependency on `lovable-common` (XPaths +
 * LovableApiClient) and registers the empty `LovableOwnerSwitch` entry
 * class. Migrations (P5), CSV (P6), UI (P7) and flow (P8–P10) plug in
 * via subsequent phases without changing this manifest's shape.
 *
 * All keys PascalCase per `mem://standards/pascalcase-json-keys`.
